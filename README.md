store in the website as long as I want, then put it on the display part to show

like reminders, after the reminder is saved and leave it there until you want to replace it

first get the value from the input text box, then make it display on the display <p>tag(i used the p tag to display the paragraph).then save it to the localStorage

## Self Reflection(s):
All the test are not working and I have to redo and redo it again. Finally I have to find the videos online and watched it over ten times and based on that one to do my own. It is horrible. And the class did not tell me anything I feel this time
## How long it took me/us to finish this:
3 days. I did not do it well. I used the source on the video I learned from
